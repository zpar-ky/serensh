    <h2>about this site</h2>
    <p>i made this :) its cobbled together and made entirely by hand.</p>
    <p>i really don't want to edit a bunch of files to change common things like the header/footer
      so there is js to load the html files, but other than that it's as simple as it gets.</p>
    <p>font is <a href="https://github.com/molarmanful/kirsch">kirsch</a> by <a href="https://github.com/molarmanful">Ben Pang</a>.
      theme is <a href="./css/source.css">garbage</a> by <a href="https://seren.sh">me</a>.</p>
    <p>free hosting with a github pages deployment and cloudflare.</p>
