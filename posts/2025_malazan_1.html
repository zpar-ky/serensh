        assuming of course, that i write another part.

        im writing this on a plane, so all I have is my memory for events. please bear with me. I also am typing this on a phone. I wish I had a laptop at least just for the joy of typing, but alas.

        relatedly, I just finished reading and closed the book Assail. this is, officially (I make the rules), the last book in the Malazan series. in all, around 18 books, if you group some of the novellas into their paperbacks. 18 books, thousands and thousands of pages. by the way, the full series name is Malazan, book of the fallen; I'll be referring to it as malazan.

        I think I began reading Malazan in 2017, eight years ago. I had just started college and I had been in a bit of a lull in reading. senior year of high school was mentally horrible for me and I don't think I could have managed reading a book. anyway, I saw some posts on reddit mentioning that the malazan series was the pinnacle of adventure/whatever fiction. there was nothing better, but the prose was very difficult. a challenge for even seasoned readers. according to someone on reddit.

      <p class="paragraph">
        I, of course, am a seasoned reader of watermark works of fiction, such as a ton of X's apprentice (assassin, etc), Alex rider, and more (surely when editing this, if I ever do, I add some more (editors note: no lol)). all difficult reads for their target audience of 11 year olds, I'm sure. anyway, I got to reading the first book early in my freshman year of college.

      <p class="paragraph">
        my reading style is what I would describe as breathless rushing forward. I read very fast (I think) (like one page/minute of the mass market paperbacks) and simply chew through the words and let my mind create the scene and play through the action. I see less of the words and more of the story visually in my head. it's somewhat unfortunate, where in some scenes when there is frantic action and rising anticipation for the culmination of events that I will read as fast as possible, skipping over unimportant words and sentences, just to progress the action.

        however, Erikson's (and Esslemont's) writing is something like one of those silly maze-like dog bowls people get to encourage their dogs to slow down when eating. the style of prose forced me to slow down, not only because there are several pages of a character's internal consternation, or the frequent discussions about the philosophy of the scene portrayed prior, but also due to the sheer breadth of vocabulary used by erikson. the frequent erratic switching between plot threads also constantly whiplashed my mental image of the scene and forced me to switch my mental context back to an entirely different cast of characters and previous events.

      <p class="paragraph">
        in the beginning of my reading of the series, I was reading on my phone with the app moonreader (highly recommended!). it was great because I could look up words that I didn't know, and I was consistently astonished at the frequency with which I was in the dictionary. i thought I knew a lot of words, but I was quickly humbled but I enjoyed seeing new words all the time. I only wish I could have remembered at least a few of them (I'm sure I do have a few), but as far as I'm aware there's dozens of neat words I wish i could force into my normal language.

        ok I'm back on a plane aka my optimal writing place apparently. im not reading whatever I wrote last time I'm sure it's amazing. nah I lied I had to go back to see what points I wanted to hit.
      </p>

        two features of Erikson's writing that go together are his frequent switching between plotlines, and the incredibly diverse cast of characters. at the end of each of the books, there is a section of dramatis personae which lists all the important characters in that book. and it's like four pages long, every time. when I starting reading gardens of the moon (gotm), I was just reading events happening and seeing all these characters names and of course really not knowing who any of them were. and after a plot switch, it was a new slew of names I still didn't quite recognize. I was enthralled in the storytelling, but I definitely wasn't as anchored in the story for the first two books, roughly. it was definitely a new reading experience - every time the plotline switched, I was probably spending one or two pages just trying to get my bearings in where (and when) in the damn world I was at.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I didn't mind it, I was already enthralled. I figured I would get there eventually, and after ten thousand pages I can say I more or less did.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph">
        the last point I wanted to get to, before I lose the thread completely, is the frequent pauses in the story. erikson has a tendency to spend a page or two or three musing some nascent (editors note: is that the right word?) topic on what just happened in the story and how it touches on, usually, the human experience, how interpersonal relationships work, or some other philosophical facet I'm too braindead to articulate. I appreciated it immensely, not only because I'm stupid, but because I'm also stupid and just read something where the meaning didn't really squelch into my brain but erikson sits me down and says no, think about this (before I send you to another continent).

      <p class="paragraph">
        was that a review of Malazan, book of the fallen? probably not. I would say more of a review of the writing style, which I think is quite important if deciding on whether or not you want to read this series.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I think I need another post to talk about just how much Erikson's writing means to me. maybe on another plane.
