        I started hrt at the beginning of the year. when I first started, I was reading posts from other trans folk talking about how starting hrt like immediately changed their brain. i kept reading those, and despite being a few months into my transition i didn't really feel too different.

        skip forward a few months, and i definitely have noticed a general change to my mood. if you haven't guessed, it's good.

        i think, for the first time in my life, i feel <i>good</i>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph">

        its really been kinda revelationary. what do you mean that this is what people normally feel like? like their whole life? people <i>don't</i> know what it's like to just exist inside a husk, an automaton that simply exists and outputs the correct words and facial expressions for the current social interaction? its... weird. my whole life up to this year i barely remember. this part i dont really know if it's something that other people experience, but most of my friends and people i talk to say that they do remember basically everything since they were like, 4 years old. im sure they're embellishing a little bit but i think comparatively they remember way damn more than i do, which is barely anything a few years ago to basically nothing when i was younger than 15. i just thought i had bad memory. then in college, i thought it was from chronic depression. now, i think it's because i wasnt there.

        when i looked in the mirror (something i rarely did, but never thought about why - funny that) i remember a few moments where i wondered what i was looking at. i dont think i saw myself in those mirrors. i never liked pictures of myself, or being in pictures. was i happy? i dont remember. sorry, i realize the last paragraphs just have been venting about my trauma. i mean its my blog, or website, or whatever, i can put whatever i want on here. and i know YOU arent going to read it, this shit is for me. anyway.

      <p style="color: gray">ok the rant is over continue with the other rant</p>

        i've been asking people about this. literally asking people if they're happy. if they feel good, most days. (i dont ask my friends because theyre all depressed and i already know what theyre going to say). i started doing this because, well, im interested in collecting data on if this is a natural phenomenon or something. also because a few months ago at work one of the whiteboards had a poll running on how everyone is feeling that day, and i was next to someone as they marked themselves down as 'feeling great' or something like that. i said like "damn great today?" and they responded with "yeah i feel great like 99% of the time". and i was like, what the fuck? are you just like high 24/7 or what. i dont know. either way, i started asking more or less random people if they feel good most of the time. and so far, yeah everyone has said that yeah they feel good or happy most of the time. possibly a shitty study because like would people i like just met tell me no they dont feel good? mm maybe not, but it is reinforcing my beliefs so im choosing to believe its a valid test.

        did i have a point there? i dont know. anyway, it feels really good feeling good. i uh, can't believe ive been missing out on this my whole life. thats ok though, i have my whole life to get used to it. although hopefully i dont, i should remember not to take it for granted. not for some self-hating reason, just because i want to hold on to it. i want to keep feeling it.
